'''
  Each item in Chefâ€™s menu is assigned a spice level from 1 to 10.
  Based on the spice level, the item is categorised as:
    MILD: If the spice level is less than 4.
    MEDIUM: If the spice level is greater than equal to 4 but less than 7.
    HOT: If the spice level is greater than equal to 7.
  Given that the spice level of an item is X, find the category it lies in.
